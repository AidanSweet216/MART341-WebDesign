            <p>
               "Up all Knight" is a simple high score based game. The player will spawn in and have to kill enemies to earn score. With each enemy the player kills another one will spawn. The player will simply fend off as many enemies as they can before dying themselves. A high will then be taken and stored locally on the device.
