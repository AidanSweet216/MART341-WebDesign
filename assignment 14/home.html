        <!-- I removed your break elements, because they were shifting your content down.
        
        Next, I've added in another div to wrap all your content in, your picture and 'about' text included, on lines 46 and 58. I've assigned a class to this div called grid-container, and in your css stylesheet, I've chosen to display this div as a grid (see lines 1-6 on your style.css page). This is because it's much easier to put your content side by side into columns effectively when you choose to display something as a CSS grid. It also makes it easier to format your page to look good on mobile, which you'll need to do for your website before turning in your final project!
    
        Any child div elements that you put inside of a div you've labeled as a grid container will automatically be treated as a section / entry of that grid. Your img was already in a div, so I didn't need to add one, but I also added in a div around your text content, too. 
    
        Finally, I moved your img up to go *before* your about text, since you wanted it placed on the left, not the right. -->
