1. User testing went very well. I got into a Discord call with a couple of my friend's from back home and had them test out my site. I got some good feedback, mostly positive. Only issue that really came up was that some of the images looked a bit off.

2. There wasn't much I changed after getting the feedback other than looking back over the images to see if there was anything wrong with them. I just tweaked some image sizes and everything looked fine

3. THe main challenge I faced this week was honestly getting started on the project. I let time slip by a bit too much procrastinated a bit on it. But I'm pretty happy with this draft of my site
