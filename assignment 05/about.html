        Bungie, Inc. is an American video game developer based in Bellevue, Washington. The company was established in May 1991 by Alex Seropian, who later brought in programmer Jason Jones after publishing Jones' game Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete. Originally based in Chicago, Illinois, the company concentrated on Macintosh games during its early years and created two successful video game franchises called Marathon and Myth.

        Microsoft acquired Bungie in 2000, and its project Halo: Combat Evolved was repurposed as a launch title for Microsoft's Xbox console. Halo became an instant hit with gamers, selling millions of copies and spawning the Halo franchise. During their time with Microsoft Bungie developed a total of 5 Halo titles before leaving Microsoft and signing with Activision in 2010 leading to the creation of Destiny in 2014 and Destiny 2 in 2017. In 2019 Bungie left Activision to once again become a fully independent studio and publish Destiny themselves. Most recently in January of 2022 Bungie was bought by Sony Interactive Entertainment but will still be able to remain independent and create games for all platforms
